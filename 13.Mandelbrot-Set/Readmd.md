Let me help you understand complex numbers and the given function sequence.

Complex Numbers:
- A complex number is of the form a + bi, where:
  * 'a' is the real component (a real number)
  * 'b' is the coefficient of the imaginary component (i)
  * 'i' is the imaginary unit, defined as √(-1)

Example: In 3 + 2i
  * Real component is 3
  * Imaginary component is 2i
  

This is the beginning of the Mandelbrot set iteration, where z is repeatedly squared and a constant c is added in each step.
Given Function Sequence f(z):
- f(z) = z² + c, where c is also a complex number
- Initial conditions:
  * z(0) = 0
  * z(1) = z² + c = c
  * z(2) = c² + c
  * z(3) = (c² + c)²
